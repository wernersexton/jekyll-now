### Network Analysis

In a recent project I wanted to explore relationships using a graphical representation and found that there wasn't much documentation on the subject and even less that didn't deal directly with people. The best resource I found was here: {Give Site Name}

Putting that together with a few other sources led me to the final conclusion so here are the steps that I took to get there. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(igraph) # Need this for the graph creation
library(dplyr) # Need this because I'm an addict
```
